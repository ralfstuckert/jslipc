Jipc Java inter process communication library

Version 0.0.3
=============

News:
-----
- new file based pipe (FilePipe)
- interface JipcPipe
- clean up and refactoring
- replaced JipcChannel.isClosedByPeer() by getState() which returns either
  Open, ClosedByPeer or Closed. Thus, semantics are more accurate.

To Adapt:
---------
- renamed MemoryMappedFilePipe to SharedMemoryPipe
- reorganized package hierarchy
